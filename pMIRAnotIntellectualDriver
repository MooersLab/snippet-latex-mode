Part of the application involves the generation of the predictions by collaborators and the testing of the predictions by the PI.
It is unclear from the application how much the PI is involved in the generation of the preductions and thus how much they are driving the project intellectually.
The PI does not highlight papers on the protein design projects where they were the senior corresponding author.
