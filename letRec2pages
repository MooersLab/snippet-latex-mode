Dear Search Committee,\\
\\
\textbf{RE: Reference Letter to University of Massachusetts for Dr. Ralf G. Janknecht.}\\
I write in support of the application of Dr. Ralf Janknecht for the open tenured position in your faculty.
I have known Dr. Janknecht since he arrived at OUHSC in 2009.
Our laboratories are about 50 paces apart and on the same floor.
We have collaborated on the JMJD4 project for several years and meet almost weekly.
We also both attend the monthly Cancer Biology group meetings, which he lead for several years.
Thus, I feel qualified to comment on his qualifications.

Dr. Janknecht has an impressive track-record of peer-reviewed publications.
These have been in the fields of gene regulation and cancer research.
He is first or senior author on many papers in journals like the highly regarded \emph{Journal of Clinical Investigation}, \emph{EMBO Journal}, \emph{Molecular and Cellular Biology}, \emph{Oncogene}, and \emph{Cancer Research}. 

His research program is focused but also agile.
He is open to adopting new techniques after careful analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.
I have often found him in his lab at the bench testing a new method.
This is unusual for a full professor.
He is manages to free up time for labwork by being very organized and efficient with his writing tasks and administrative duties. 

Dr. Janknecht is always willing to share his expertise in a friendly manner.
His openness has benefited many principal investigators.
He has collaborated with other faculty within and outside our institution.
His collaborations resulted in him serving many times as co-author on papers in journals like \emph{Journal of Biological Chemistry} and \emph{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}. 

One of these collaborations involves the JMJD4 protein with my laboratory. 
His laboratory has created a JMJD4 knock-out mouse.
The Janknecht lab has since obtained \emph{in vivo} evidence that JMJD4 acts like an oncoprotein.
JMJD4 is an enzyme, so Dr. Janknecht thought about developing small molecule inhibitors that target JMJD4.
This is when he approached my lab. 


We are experienced in determining X-ray crystal structures of proteins. 
We are also adept in modeling protein structures and docking small molecules to them. 
We have identified small molecules that potentially inhibit JMJD4 activity. 
Dr. Janknecht, Dr. Burgett (a medicinal chemist), and myself have collaborated on developing inhibitors for JMJD4 and on determining the structure of JMJD4. 
We have been able to acquire several local grants to support this research.
Our goal is to  apply for federal funding (NIH, DOD) by submitting multi-PI grants.
This project demonstrates the willingness of Dr. Janknecht to pursue common goals.

Dr. Janknecht is also a dedicated teacher.
He currently teaches incoming graduate students, medical students, and allied health students.
His teaching load is more than that of most other research-focused faculty at OUHSC.
Dr. Janknecht has mentored several undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty.
These activities attest to Dr. Janknechtâ€™s dedication to training the next generation of scientists.


In addition, Dr. Janknecht has a record of outstanding service to our institution.
He is the Chair of the time-consuming Institutional Biosafety Committee.
He has also been a leader of the Cancer Biology Program, of which I have been a member.
Thus, I have first-hand experience with his energetic, enthusiastic, effective, and impartial leadership.
This leadership position is not easy because this is a diverse group of scientists.
He leveraged several small grants to support exciting research projects.
Many of these projects eventually were awarded federal funding.
He also serves regularly on the study sections for several local grant programs.
At the national level, Dr. Janknecht has served as a reviewer on many DOD and NIH study sections.

Dr. Janknecht has proven to be a very productive and successful researcher. 
He is also a highly respected and cooperative colleague. 
I predict that he will be an outstanding contributor in your department and university. 
I wish that I had more colleagues like him. 
I will be happy to discuss further by phone the qualifications of Dr. Janknecht.

{Best regards,} \\
