# snippet-latex-mode

Blaine's code snippets for the latex-mode of Emacs. 
The goal is to reduce the tedious parts of using LaTeX, cope with trouble recalling commands, and to reduce errors and thus debugging time.

Formatted for the famous yasnippet package.
There is one snippet per file.
The file names should match the tabtigger.
The snippets have tab triggers and tab stops.

The files are grouped by function or topic but are not stored in separate subfolders.
The group name appears as a submenu in the yasnippet pulldown menu.

My favorite snippets are for inserting URLs as footnotes, creating lists, equation envs with captions, tables, minted code blocks, and article templates.

Git clone the library to into `~/.emacs.d/snippets/latex-mode`.
If you use chemacs, git clone into `~/.emacs.defualt/snippets/latex-mode`.
You may have to create the subfolders.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/MooersLab/snippet-latex-mode ~/.emacs.d/snippets/latex-mode
```
