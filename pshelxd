\subsection{Protocol for setting up and running shelxd jobs on Schooner}

\begin{enumerate}
\item mkdir 2663recShelx in your home directory
\item cd 2663recShelx
\item copy  2695p2shelx.sbatch, 2695p2.ins, mtz2shelx.com to the current directory. Also copy the mtz file.
\item Edit mtz2shelx.com resolution limits and wavelength. 
\item Enter 'module load ccp4/7.0.075' so that you can run mtz2various.
\item Run ./mtz2shelx.com. You will need the resolution limits and the unit cell parameters that are written to the screen.
\item mv 2695p2.ins to stemHKLfilename.ins
\item edit 2663rec.ins
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  TITL stemHKLfilename
  \item Edit ZERR
  \item Insert wavelength and unit cell parameters
  \item Go to \url{https://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx/shelx.html} to get LATT and SYMM cards via SG number via the webb app.
  \item Edit the SHEL card by entering the resolution range
  \item Edit the SFAC and UNIT lines. This information can be derived from the record in the sir file or run ccp4's rwcontents on a related PDB file to get number of atoms by element in the asu. Multiply by the number of ASUs.
  \item Adjust PLOP as needed
\end{enumerate}
\item Edit the *.sbatch file. In vim, use :\%s/2695p2/2663rec/g to do global search and replace. 
\item  Submit job with sbatch ./2663rec.sbatch.
\item  Check that job is running with cj
\item  Check the 2663rec.lst and 2663rec.pdb files in Vim or via tail -500 or head -500.
\end{enumerate}
