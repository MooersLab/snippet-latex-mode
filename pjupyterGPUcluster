As on schooner, I had created the required kernels.

On local computer, enter the following command. Note the whitespace between the period right of the left quote.

nohup ssh -f bmooers@mooers.hsc.net.ou.edu ". /home/bmooers/anaconda3/bin/activate;jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip '*' --notebook-dir /home/bmooers"

Check on the local computer the file nohup.out for the token.

On the local computer, enter the following ssh command and login to the cluster:

ssh -L 8892:127.0.0.1:8888 bmooers@mooers.hsc.net.ou.edu

In the browser on the local computer, enter localhost:8892

In the resulting password box, enter the token from the nohup.out file on the local computer.

Best regards,

Blaine
