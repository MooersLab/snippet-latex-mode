The written English shows good adherence to the proper use of punctuation, but I found numerous errors in word choice and some missing articles (e.g., "the").
Errors of this nature can be detected with many grammar checkers (E.g., Grammarly, Writeful, LanguageTool, and so on). 
Some of these grammar checkers have plugins for word processors or extensions in webbrowsers for editing text in text box on webpages, including on-line editors like Overleaf. 
Nonetheless, I recommend using at least two of these tools because they are complementary in nature.
