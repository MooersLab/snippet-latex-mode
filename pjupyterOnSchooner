Protocol for running Jupyter notebook on schooner.
Should be adaptable to Jupyter Lab.

1) Add the following lines to your .bashrc file to activate the base env on login

. /opt/oscer/software/Miniconda3/4.4.10/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate

2) Create a kernel for your conda env.
Jupyter or at least ipykernel must be install in your conda env.
The display-name is the name shown in the notebook.

conda activate cryodrgn
python -m ipykernel install --user --name cryodrgn --display-name "cryodrgn python3.7"

Check for the presence of the kernel file by entering

jupyter --data

/home/bmooers/.local/share/jupyter

This will return the path to the local jupyter library

ls -ltr /home/bmooers/.local/share/jupyter/kernels



3) Create a launchNotebook.sh slurm script.

#!/bin/bash
#launch jupyter

#SBATCH -p mooerslab_extended_cpu
#SBATCH -J classic
#SBATCH --time 0:50:00
#SBATCH -N 1 #total number of nodes and processes

# Setup Environment
source activate base

export XDG_RUNTIIME_DIR=""

jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip "*" \
            --notebook-dir /home/bmooers

4) chmod +x launchNotebook.sh

5) Submit the jupyter notebook job to the queue.

sbatch ./launchNotebook.sh

6) cj # checkjobs. Once job is running, note the node that is being used.

7) In another terminal on your local computer, enter the following. The first port number is on your local computer.

ssh -L 8892:c398.oscer.ou.edu:8888  bmooers@schooner.oscer.ou.edu

8) On your local computer, enter localhost:8892 in the browser.
You will see a window for the password or token.

9) On schooner, get the token from the *.sout file.
Paste the token into the above password box.
The jupyter notebook home page will open.
Select the desired kernel to open a new netbook.
Enter !ls to display the contents of your home directory on schooner.
